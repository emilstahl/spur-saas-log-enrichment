# spur-saas-log-enrichment

Detects anonymising VPN/proxy and watchlisted IPs across Slack, Zoom, Teamtailor and Okta
logs and posts new findings to Slack. `slack_alert_cron.py` runs every 30 minutes; see
`README.md` for configuration and the data sources.

Read the ground rules below before running anything.

## One-off security checks

Notes for whoever (person or agent) picks this repo up to answer a question like "is this
user / IP / applicant a problem?". The scheduled job is the automated side; everything here
is the manual side.

## Ground rules

These have all been learned the hard way. Break them and you either page someone at 2am or
accuse an innocent person of being a North Korean operative.

1. **Never run `slack_alert_cron.py` live for a check.** It takes a lock, posts to Slack,
   writes profile notes on real candidates and advances the watermark. Use `--dry-run`, or
   run `anomaly_detector.py` directly with `--output` pointing somewhere scratch.
2. **Never write `.slack_alert_state.json`, `.teamtailor_noted.json`,
   `.teamtailor_ai_noted.json` or `.slack_alert_watermark.json` by hand.** Writing the
   watermark makes the next scheduled run skip a window; writing the state file makes real
   findings never alert.
3. **Before adding anything to `data.csv`, check whether a human already signs in from it.**
   On 2026-09-28 eleven ThreatInsight IPs were added and four turned out to be employees'
   own home addresses, because ThreatInsight fires on failed-login bursts and a locked-out
   employee produces those too. The gate is in "Checking a candidate watchlist entry" below.
4. **A Teamtailor false positive is not noise.** The cron writes a note on the candidate's
   profile saying they are a suspected DPRK IT worker and must not be progressed. Prefer a
   missed detection over a wrong accusation: add the observed address, not the whole range,
   unless you have measured the range.
5. **Don't bulk-add addresses your own staff use.** Okta's `isProxy` addresses are staff
   addresses by definition; they belong in a per-finding signal, not a blocklist.
6. **Throttle.** Okta's budget is ~60 requests/minute and the cron uses some of it every
   30 minutes. A long backfill should stay at or below ~32/min or it starves the cron,
   which fails the run, which suppresses the healthcheck ping, which pages a human.

## Checking one user

```bash
./user_check.py simone.torre@team.blue          # last 30 days
./user_check.py "Simone Torre" --days 90        # display-name prefix
./user_check.py sabir.buxsoo@team.blue --events # plus every event
```

Prints every IP with country, network, watchlist status and Okta's `isProxy` verdict, then
the OS/browser mix, outcomes and event types, and ends with the addresses worth a look.
Read-only. `relay` in the flags column means iCloud Private Relay (Akamai/Cloudflare/Fastly)
and is benign; `PROXY` means anonymising infrastructure that is not a relay.

Absence of events is evidence too: if someone reports a failure and there are no failed
events, their traffic never reached Okta — usually a VPN or network block on their side.

## Checking one Slack user

```bash
./user_logins.py <SLACK_USER_ID> [DAYS]
```

## Checking an IP or a range

```python
from enrichment.file_enrichment import FileEnrichment
w = FileEnrichment('data.csv')
w.lookup('1.2.3.4')     # operator tag, or None. Handles CIDR entries.
```

## Checking a candidate watchlist entry (the gate)

Before adding any address or range, confirm no human signs in from it successfully. The
cheapest source is Okta, which covers all staff:

```python
import gzip, glob, json
from enrichment.file_enrichment import FileEnrichment
w = FileEnrichment('candidates.csv')          # ip,operator — the entries you want to add
for fn in glob.glob('<scratch>/okta-*/**/*.jsonl.gz', recursive=True):
    with gzip.open(fn, 'rt') as fh:
        for line in fh:
            e = json.loads(line)
            if e.get('atype') == 'User' and e.get('ip') and w.lookup(e['ip']) \
                    and e.get('out') in ('SUCCESS', 'ALLOW'):
                print('COLLISION', e['ip'], e.get('email'))
```

Any hit on a `@team.blue` account means do not add that entry. Attempted usernames that are
not `@team.blue` with only `FAILURE` outcomes are the attack, not a collision.

If no local event dump exists, pull one with `OktaExtractor` day by day (see
`extractors/okta_extractor.py`) at the throttle above.

## Ad-hoc detector run

```bash
/home/esp/venv/bin/python anomaly_detector.py --enrichment file --ip-file data.csv \
  --hours 168 --output /tmp/scratch/check.json
# Okta only:        --no-teamtailor --slack-token '' --zoom-account-id ''
# then replay it through the cron, still without posting:
./slack_alert_cron.py --dry-run /tmp/scratch/check.json
```

`--hours` takes fractions. The detector reads `.env` itself, so no environment setup.

## Things that are not what they look like

- **`x-rate-limit-reset` means different things.** Teamtailor sends seconds remaining; Okta
  sends an absolute Unix timestamp. Same header name.
- **Zoom's Dashboard API takes whole dates**, so a sub-day window still lists the whole day's
  meetings. `ZoomExtractor._overlaps` filters them client side.
- **`policy.evaluate_sign_on` carries the DENY/CHALLENGE decisions**, not `user.session.start`.
  A network-zone block appears there and nowhere else, which is why every Okta event type is
  pulled rather than a hand-written list.
- **Geolocation is Okta's and is sometimes wrong.** AS7849 resolves to "Greenfield, Wisconsin"
  for addresses on a Western Massachusetts ISP. Don't build a case on geo alone.
- **A quiet log may mean retries absorbed the problem.** Teamtailor stalls only surface now if
  one survives three attempts.

## Backups

Anything that edits `data.csv` or `.env` should copy it to `<file>.bak-YYYYMMDD-<what>` first.
Both are gitignored, as are all the state files.
